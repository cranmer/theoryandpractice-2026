### Bio

Kyle Cranmer is the David R. Anderson Director of the UW-Madison Data Science Institute and a Professor of Physics with courtesy appointments in Statistics and Computer Science. He is also the Editor in Chief of the journal Machine Learning Science and Technology. Cranmer was a Professor of Physics and Data Science at NYU from 2007 – 2022. He obtained his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2005. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Science and Engineering in 2007, the National Science Foundation's Career Award in 2009, and became a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2021 for his work at the Large Hadron Collider. Professor Cranmer developed a framework that enables collaborative statistical modeling, which was used extensively for the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. His current interests are at the intersection of physics, statistics, and machine learning.
