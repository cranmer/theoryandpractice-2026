## ✈️ Travel & Talks

Here’s a list of the major trips I took this year, with a bit of narrative for each one:

* **Geneva, January** — I made a pilgramiage to CERN for the **25th anniversary of the PhyStat conference series**. PhyStat was the first conference I ever attended as a student, and that community became a large part of my professional identity. Being invited to give a keynote focused on the next 25 years brought me full circle.
* **Houston, January** — I also made a pilgramiage back to Rice University (my alma mater) to give a [distinguished lecture at the Ken Kennedy Institute](https://youtu.be/Vxvf6No8LsE?si=lW7JArW0qa_eEIfH). 
* **Hamburg, February** — My first trip to **DESY** as a member of the scientific review committee. It’s an impressive laboratory, and I also enjoyed giving a colloquium talk there — something I had looked forward to since a planned trip in 2020 was canceled due to COVID.
* **Tucson, March** — My first event talking to **UW alumni about AI** — a great opportunity to engage the Wisconsin community beyond campus. 
* **Costa Rica, March** — Spring break with the family: beaches near Manuel Antonio and adventures around Arenal (yes, including zip lines!).
* **Anaheim, March** — I gave a talk at the American Physical Society conference. While I was there, I also ran into old friends Paul and Ágnes from my Brookhaven days and Crystal from high school. 
* **China & Hong Kong, April** — In my role as Editor-in-Chief of *Machine Learning: Science and Technology*, I made an amazing trip visiting **Shanghai, Hangzhou, Shenzhen**, and wrapping up with a day of sightseeing in **Hong Kong**. I gave multiple talks including a science café in Hangzhou, a seminar in Shenzhen, a talk at the **TD Lee Institute**, and at the **AI for Science Conference at Fudan University**.
* **Paris & Marseille, July** — I taught at the **AI for Science summer school in Paris** and then went to **Marseille** to give an invited talk at the EPS particle physics conference about AI and physics.
* **Up Nort', Wisconsin, August** — A family vacation at a lake house at "Nice Lake" (seriously). It was very serene -- we saw otters and heard loons. 
* **New York, August** — A family vacation revisiting old neighborhoods and catching up with friends.
* **Green Bay, August** — I gave a talk titled [How is AI Revolutionizing Science?](https://www.youtube.com/live/7V3ue6VxQv4?si=kNtgkLMx3b7z4cDQ) at the Neville Public Museum in Green Bay, which was aired on PBS Wisconsin. 
* **Heidelberg, September** — Attended the **Heidelberg Laureate Forum**, including [a panel on AI and science](https://youtu.be/I-Ye-rMhRws?si=lEWrqKuPTJ-rMnwL). A highlight was sharing a short essay called [*The Bittersweet Lesson*]({filename}/the-bittersweet-lesson.md) and getting to chat with Rich Sutton about it.
* **CalTech, November** — I received the inaugural **Pritzker Prize for AI and Science** at a conference at Caltech — an incredible honor. While in the area I also ran into old friends Paul and Ágnes from my Brookhaven days.
* **San Diego, December** — Wrapped the year at **NeurIPS**, where we hosted the 8th annual [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences](http://ml4physicalsciences.github.io) workshop. Leaving chilly Madison for sunny Southern California was a welcome bonus. words

## 🏛️ Data Science Institute & RISE-AI

A lot happened this year at the **Data Science Institute (DSI)** and with the **RISE-AI** initiative:

* In the **spring** we secured approval to hire **four AI/ML engineers** to support RISE-AI, receiving **over 1,300 applications** for these roles.
* We celebrated **Maja Rudolph** — previously a Research Professor at DSI — in her new role as a **tenure-track Assistant Professor in Statistics**.
* In **August**, **DSI was selected to be the RISE-AI Collaboration Headquarters**, and I was honored to be appointed **Lead of the RISE-AI HQ**, a campus-wide hub for AI research, teaching, and engagement at **UW–Madison**. More on this in the [UW–Madison news release](https://news.wisc.edu/rise-ai-collaboration-hq-to-build-connections-and-advance-research-teaching-and-engagement/). 
* That same month, **UW–Madison joined the AI Alliance**, joining a global community committed to advancing safe, responsible AI rooted in open innovation. See the announcement on the [DSI site](https://dsi.wisc.edu/2025/09/22/uw-madison-joins-the-ai-alliance/). 
* We moved into **Morgridge Hall** in August alongside campus partners. ([more][5])
* In **April**, we held our **inaugural open awards** at the Research Bazaar — recognizing exciting open science contributions. ([more][https://ospo.wisc.edu/activities/open-awards])
* We hired **Anna Haensch** as a new Research Professor who will spend half her time as the Associate Director for the new Digital Scholarship Hub in the Libraries. Anna is awesome, check out her profile at [https://annahaensch.com/](https://annahaensch.com/).
* We partnered with **UW Extension** to host events on the promise and risks associated to the use of AI for local governments including the **Wisconsin Towns Association**, **Wisconsin League of Municipalities**, and **Wisconsin Counties Association**.
* The **Sloan Foundation renewed support for our Open Source Program Office**, complementing our open awards and AI Alliance efforts.
* The **NSF funded our Center for Industrial Research and Community Service (CIRCS) IUCRC** focused on *severe convective storms and insurance industry challenges* — an exciting interdisciplinary effort (see [https://circs.niu.edu/](https://circs.niu.edu/) and [https://iucrc.nsf.gov/](https://iucrc.nsf.gov/)).
