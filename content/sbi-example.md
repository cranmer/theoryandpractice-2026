I created this pedagogical example about simulation-based inference for a set of lectures that I gave in Paris in July 2025 for the University of Chicago's AI for Science summer school. The repository is [here](https://github.com/cranmer/sbi-tutorial/) and it includes instructions on how to run the tutorial on your own machine.
